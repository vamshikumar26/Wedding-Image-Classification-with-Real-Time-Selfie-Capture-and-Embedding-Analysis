# Wedding Image Classification and Real-Time Selfie Recognition using Embeddings

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to classify wedding-related images and perform real-time selfie-based matching. After training on a dataset of wedding images, the system captures a live selfie, generates facial embeddings, and retrieves and displays the most similar wedding images from the dataset.

## Project Overview

- Trains a model on a dataset of wedding images
- Captures a selfie image from the camera
- Extracts face embeddings using a pre-trained model (e.g., FaceNet or similar)
- Compares embeddings to find and display similar wedding-related images
- Provides a web interface for user interaction

--python train_model.py  (Make sure your dataset is correctly organized and available before running).

--python app.py


How It Works
-> Train a CNN model on wedding image data.

-> Capture a selfie using the webcam via the app.

-> Generate embeddings from the captured selfie.

-> Compare the embeddings with those of the dataset images.

-> Display the top matched wedding images based on similarity.
